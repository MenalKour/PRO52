        <p><i>Interesting facts about camel!!</i></p>
<li>There are two types of camels: One humped or “dromedary” camels and two humped Bactrian camels.
Camels have three sets of eyelids and two rows of eyelashes to keep sand out of their eyes.
Camels have thick lips which let them forage for thorny plants other animals can’t eat.
Camels can completely shut their nostrils during sandstorms.
Thanks to thick pads of skin on their chest and knees, camels can comfortably sit in very hot sand.</li>
<li>Their humps let them store up to 80 pounds of fat which they can live off for weeks and even months!
When a camel finally does find water, he can drink up to 40 gallons in one go.
Camels are very strong and can carry up to 900 pounds for 25 miles a day.
Camels can travel at up to 40 miles per hour – the same as a racehorse!

        <p><i>Interesting facts about chameleon!!</i></p>
<li>Chameleons are a very unique branch of the lizard group of reptiles.
There are around 160 species of chameleon.
Chameleons live in warm varied habitats from rainforests through to deserts.
Almost half of the world's chameleon species are native to Madagascar, they are also found in Africa, and southern Europe to as far as Sri Lanka in Asia and have been introduced to Hawaii, California and Florida.
Special color pigment cells under the skin called chromatophores allow some chameleon species to change their skin color, creating combined patterns of pink, blue, red, orange, green, black, brown, yellow and purple.
Chameleon change color for camouflage but this is not always the main reason. Some show darker colors when angry, or when trying to scare others. Males show light multi-colored patterns when vying for female attention. Desert varieties change to black when its cooler to absorb heat, then a light grey to reflect heat.</li>
<li>Chameleons have amazing eyes. The bulging upper and lower eyelids are joined and the pupil peaks out from a pinhole sized gap.
The chameleons' eyes can rotate and focus separately on 180-degree arcs, so they can see two different objects at the same time. This gives them a full 360-degree field of vision.
Chameleons actual eyesight is great they can see small insects 5-10 meters away. They can also see in both visible and ultraviolet light.
Chameleons feed by ballistically projecting their tongues often over twice the length of their body to catch prey, forming a suction cup as it hits its target.
The chameleons tongue can reach its prey in just 0.07 split seconds, with the projectile acceleration reaching over 41 g's of force.</li>
<li>Chameleons usually eat large insects such as locusts, grasshoppers, crickets, and stick insects, some bigger species also eat other lizards and young birds.
Chameleons are not deaf but they do not actually have ear openings.
Many species of chameleon have horn-like bumps or crests on their heads.
Species of chameleon can be as small as 15 mm (0.59 in) or as large as 69 cm (27 in).</li>

        <p><i>Interesting facts about pigeon!!</i></p>
<li>Pigeons are incredibly complex and intelligent animals. They are one of only a small number of species to pass the ‘mirror test’ – a test of self recognition. They can also recognise each letter of the human alphabet, differentiate between photographs, and even distinguish different humans within a photograph.
Pigeons are renowned for their outstanding navigational abilities. They use a range of skills, such as using the sun as a guide and an internal ‘magnetic compass’. A study at Oxford University found that they will also use landmarks as signposts and will travel along man-made roads and motorways, even changing direction at junctions.
Pigeons are highly sociable animals. They will often be seen in flocks of 20-30 birds.
Pigeons mate for life, and tend to raise two chicks at the same time.
Both female and male pigeons share responsibility of caring for and raising young. Both sexes take turn incubating the eggs and both feed the chicks ‘pigeon milk’ – a special secretion from the lining of the crop which both sexes produce.</li>
<li>Pigeons have excellent hearing abilities. They can detect sounds at far lower frequencies than humans are able to, and can thus hear distant storms and volcanoes.
Despite the social perception as dirty and disease-ridden, pigeons are actually very clean animals and there is very little evidence to suggest that they are significant transmitters of disease.
Pigeons and humans have lived in close proximity for thousands of years. The first recordings of this date back to Mesopotamis, modern Iraq, in 3000bc.
Although pigeon droppings are seen by some as a problem in modern society, a few centuries ago pigeon guano was seen as extremely valuable. It was viewed as the best available fertiliser and armed guards would even stand by dovecotes (pigeon houses) to stop others taking the droppings.</li>
<li>Pigeons can fly at altitudes up to and beyond 6000 feet, and at an average speed of 77.6 mph. The fastest recorded speed is 92.5 mph.
Pigeons are fed by many members of different religions including Muslims, Hindus and Sikhs for spiritual reasons. Some older Sikhs will ceremoniously feed them in honour of Guru Gobind Singh, a high priest who was renowned as a friend to pigeons.</li>

        <p><i>Interesting facts about Teddy Bear!!</i></p>
<li>Morris Michtom might not have foreseen his invention of stuffed bears becoming a staple for our childhood, but he knew this was a great idea. 
Placing two bears in his store window, his toy store quickly hosted a plethora of interested customers. Mitchtom requested permission from Theodore Roosevelt to call the bears “Teddy’s bears”, as “Teddy” was Roosevelt’s nickname.
It’s rumored that Michtom wanted to remind people of Roosevelt’s compassion, specifically the day he decided shooting an unconscious bear (tied to a tree) was unsportsman like; he put the bear out of misery peacefully.
This act gained a lot of love and respect from Americans. 
Now, any story that starts like that is one worth telling.</li>
<li>The first teddy bear went on sale in 1903, but there’s so much more to this companion than dates and facts. 
The teddy bear becomes special when we add our own personal experiences in with its own rich history.
As the first of two Teddy Bears resides at the National Museum of American History, encourage your child to keep his or her teddy when done with it, and explain why.
It may already be family tradition to pass down a Teddy, but if not, you can start now. Whatever bear style you choose, just remember to love it, and the rest will come naturally.
When you pass it on to children and grandchildren, their friendship with it will fill you with an amount of love you didn’t even know existed.
One of the best parts of becoming a parent is sharing with your kids, the things you loved as a child.</li>
<li>The first time bears appeared in the literal sense was in the 1834 tale “Goldilocks and the Three Bears” by Robert Southey.
    Bear toys existed, though not in stuffed form, and were called Bruins.
    In 1924, Disney’s Alice and the Three Bears was the first color-animated film about teddy bears!
    Wendy Boston changed lives in 1954, when she invented a washable teddy bear! Go Wendy! We bet you would have loved Teddy needs a Bath!</li>
